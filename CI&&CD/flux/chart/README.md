# Flux chart

This directory contains a chart for flux. See [the README.md there](./flux/README.md) for
instructions on how to use it.

## Publishing new charts

We use GitHub pages to publish the chart as a versioned package. The
tarballs and index.yaml file are updated with a script in that branch.
